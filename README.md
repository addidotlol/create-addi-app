# create-addi-app

An interactive CLI that scaffolds an `addi-stack` app that uses SvelteKit, Cloudflare Workers / D1, Drizzle, Better-Auth & shadcn-svelte.

## Getting Started

Using your favorite package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun, deno) run the following command:

```bash
npm|pnpm|yarn|bun|deno create addi-app@latest
```

Currently, there is no support for CLI flags. This will come in a later update.
